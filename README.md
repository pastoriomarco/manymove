This repository is intended primarily for my own use as a roboticist, to deploy cobots in production using ROS2.
This is HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL and comes with no warranty of stability or safety: USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
IMPORTANT SAFETY NOTICE: this repository does not cover safety functions. Safety MUST be implemented using the internal safety system of the robot's controller and/or an appropriate safety controller, in compliance with your countryâ€™s regulations.
